# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, @onepoint-southbelgium and @pivielti
# will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @onepoint-southbelgium @pivielti

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# When someone opens a pull request that only modifies JS files, only @pivielti
# and not @onepoint-southbelgium owner will be requested for a review.

# XYou can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be used to look up
# users just like we do for commit author emails.
